","Eating Primally means eating real food, not food from a box or meal delivery service. You will enjoy “primally-approved” foods that you can buy from your local grocery store and you will receive some starter recipes as part of the program. ","Initially, you can do most of the primally-approved movements with just your body weight and some things you have around the house. Eventually, you will either want access to a gym or some basic dumbbells or kettlebells. Primal man was strong, lean and healthy without fancy equipment or elaborate gyms.  ","Primal man enjoyed a rich array of foods from his local habit and obtained all of the nutrients from the land as well as local plants and animals. By sticking with real foods and reducing “anti-nutrients” found in our modern diets, you should obtain all of the nutrients that your body requires. You may find that you need to fill in the gaps with some supplements at some point but I don’t advocate supplements right away.

On primal, we enjoy a generous amount of complex carbs (vegetables and fruits) just as our primal ancestors did. While you may occasionally find yourself in a ketogenic state, this is not our goal. The majority of your calories will come from healthy protein choices as well as good fats and we will add in enough complex carbohydrates to fuel your daily activities. Most people find that they are less hungry, their blood sugar levels are much lower and their energy levels are higher by this way of eating.
