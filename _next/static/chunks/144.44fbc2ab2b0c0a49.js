I needed a program that I could stick with!","So why not follow a lifestyle with over 10,000 years of proven success?","Epigenetics",],s=["Despite thinking that I was pretty healthy in my 40’s, at a routine\n        annual physical, my doctor informed me that I was headed for big\n        trouble. For almost 20 years, I had been exercising regularly and eating\n        what I thought was healthy, but my weight had been steadily increasing,\n        I was tired all the time, and I just didn’t have the drive I used to\n        have in my 20s and 30s. Like so many other men, I believed that I hit an\n        age where my body would just start breaking down. Then my doctor dropped\n        the bomb: my blood sugar was in the pre-diabetic range. He was concerned\n        about my heart health and even wanted to start me on diabetes and heart\n        medication. I decided to “get serious” and go hard with a new diet and\n        exercise regime to lose weight and fix my underlying poor health\n        condition. But I realized…","This modern lifestyle, which I had thought was the epitome of health, was actually slowly destroying my body. Crash diets and intense cardio routines are advertised as the solution to modern health problems and weight-loss, but they’re unsustainable because they focus on short-term remedies instead of sustainable, long-term results. \nAlso, what I believed was the “right way” to exercise was actually contributing to my health woes! I needed something that was realistic and sustainable and would help me with my diet, exercise and lifestyle. \n","Many of us have accepted our fate as we age. \nYou might see your friends, relatives, or colleagues whose medicine cabinets look like pharmacies, and who are following the latest unsustainable health trends, and decide that taking charge of your health is impossible.\nYou have a spouse, a family, a job…all of which require a ton of time. If you’re like me, you’ve dedicated a large part of your life to your job and your kids and… Somewhere along the line, you forgot about you! \nNo matter what your focus is, you probably can’t give 100% of your attention to researching the right diet and workout routine for yourself…\n","The Primal Living Approach: at its core it is about reconnecting with how our bodies and brains are genetically hardwired to function - while still making the most of the modern conveniences, medical advances, and benefits of modern life.\nThe PrimalGuy approach is about following in the footsteps of our ancestors and living in a way that truly allows our bodies and minds to thrive without being held hostage to a multitude of drugs. And no, you won’t have to eat raw meat or drink from a pond like our ancestors did. You also won’t have to spend hours sweating in the gym or eat strange foods. . \nOver time, we have forgotten what health really means- health is about more than not being sick. We focus on losing weight by any means necessary, but are still unable to participate in the physical activities we love because they are so disconnected from their bodies.\nBut why have we lost touch with our health? \nWell, our lifestyle and environment actually affect the way our genes work! It’s called: \nEpigenetics\n","Our modern world and the behaviors we have adapted to have changed our genes… for the worse. Certain gene expressions are turned on or off based on our environment and the way we treat our body.\nFor example, unlike our resilient ancestors, the modern man has become dependent on medicine to keep him healthy. \nBut luckily these changes are reversible! We still have access to our most primal genes that will allow us to look good and feel good as we age. \nMy modern primal program covers the three pillars of health: \nDiet\nFitness\nLifestyle\nSo you can turn on those primal genes that the modern world has repressed.\nIt is a straightforward, comprehensive program designed for you to continue coming back to and it’s all based on…\nThe 10 Simple Laws of Primal Living\n",];t.default=function(e){var t=e.index;return(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:r().card,children:[(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:r().cardTitle,children:i[t]}),(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:r().cardContent,children:s[t]})]})}},9091:function(e){e.exports={card:"Card_card__x_YCT",cardTitle:"Card_cardTitle__dcodN",cardIngridentTitle:"Card_cardIngridentTitle__53zm5",cardIngrident:"Card_cardIngrident__yWRMf",cardContentTitle:"Card_cardContentTitle__hmHUT",cardContent:"Card_cardContent__KX7_M",cardButton:"Card_cardButton__hodwA",focus:"Card_focus__Uah68",active:"Card_active__db599",heroImage:"Card_heroImage__KDdF_",centerImage:"Card_centerImage__NL_Ic",readmoreButton:"Card_readmoreButton__rPiyv"}}}]);
